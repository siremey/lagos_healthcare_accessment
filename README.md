Assessment of the Distribution and Accessibility of Lagos Healthcare Facilities

<bold>Abstract

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a paramount goal for many nations, including Nigeria, aiming to ensure all citizens have access to high-quality healthcare services. However, the road to achieving UHC, particularly in geographically diverse regions with rapidly growing populations, is fraught with significant challenges. The most pressing of these challenges is ensuring equitable distribution and accessibility of health facilities, a complex issue that demands immediate attention.<br>
This study provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution of healthcare centers and accessibility in Lagos. It's a crucial step towards addressing the issue of healthcare facility availability, ensuring that no area is left underserved. This, in turn, will significantly contribute to the realization of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in the city.<br>
The findings from this study are of significant importance, revealing that Ikeja and Ibeju Lekki boast the best healthcare coverage, with a rate above 2.4. This rate, which refers to the number of healthcare centers per 10,000 people, is a crucial metric for understanding healthcare accessibility. LGAs such as Badagry, Eti-Osa, Surulere, Lagos Mainland, Oshodi, and Ikorodu also demonstrate commendable healthcare delivery coverage, with a rate of over two healthcare centers to 10,000 people. However, Ajeromi/Ifelodun and Alimosho have the least healthcare coverage, with a rate of one or fewer healthcare coverage per 10,000 people.<br>
This research provides valuable insights for planning the establishment and provision of healthcare facilities. By ensuring optimal and equitable distribution in setting up and establishing healthcare centers, the ministries can effectively address the population's healthcare needs.
